    "This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify customer complaints. By training an NLP model to understand the content of complaints, the system can reduce the number of questions customers need to answer before submitting their issues. The primary goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To minimize the time customers spend logging complaints by reducing the number of survey questions.\n",
    "2. To create a user-friendly platform that allows customers to quickly submit their complaints or feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train an NLP model to automatically classify consumer complaints into predefined categories based on their content.\n",
    "* Enhance the customer complaint logging experience by streamlining the complaint submission process.\n",
    "* Improve financial institutions' responsiveness by providing faster, more accurate categorization of complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will explore the use of machine learning models such as text classification algorithms, potentially including logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks, combined with advanced NLP techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to understand the nature of customer complaints effectively."

    "**Problem Statement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers of financial institutions often experience significant frustration and dissatisfaction when lodging complaints related to financial services. The existing complaint submission processes typically involve navigating through multiple selection options or answering a series of questions generated by chatbots. This complexity not only prolongs the time required to submit a complaint but also adds to customer frustration, especially when timely resolution is critical. There is a pressing need for a faster and more efficient method for customers to lodge complaints without the burden of excessive questioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Causes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complex Navigation Structures:** Current platforms require customers to traverse numerous menus and options, making the submission process cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inefficient Chatbot Interactions:** Chatbots often generate redundant or irrelevant questions, leading to extended interaction times and increased customer irritation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lack of Personalization:** The absence of tailored pathways for different types of complaints results in a one-size-fits-all approach that does not address specific customer needs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inadequate Data Utilization:** Existing systems may not fully leverage customer data to streamline the complaint submission process, leading to repetitive information requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key stakeholders:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Customers:** Play a crucial role in submitting complaints and providing feedback regarding financial services. They are primarily interested in seeking a quick and hassle-free method to lodge complaints and receive timely resolutions. To achieve this, customers require an intuitive and straightforward complaint submission interface that minimizes the number of steps and questions needed to lodge a complaint. Additionally, they seek assurance that their issues will be resolved promptly and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Customer Service Support Teams:** Responsible for handling and resolving customer complaints efficiently. Their primary interest lies in managing and categorizing incoming complaints swiftly to expedite resolutions. To support these goals, they require simplified complaint categorization processes that speed up resolution times. Additionally, access to comprehensive and accurate complaint data is essential for effective management. Tools that allow them to track and monitor complaint statuses efficiently are also necessary to maintain high levels of service quality."

    "The Consumer Complaints Dataset from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) provides a comprehensive source of real-world data on consumer grievances about various financial products and services. This dataset, accessible to the public, is particularly useful for natural language processing (NLP) projects, as it includes detailed narratives describing consumer complaints. These narratives cover disputes ranging from credit reporting issues to debt collection practices, providing a valuable foundation for developing an NLP model that can automatically classify and route complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset version we leveraged from kaggle includes thousands of consumer submissions categorized into five (5) financial product classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit Reporting\n",
    "* Debt Collection\n",
    "* Mortgages and Loans (includes car loans, payday loans, student loans, etc.)\n",
    "* Credit Cards \n",
    "* Retail Banking (includes checking/savings accounts, as well as money transfers, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of around 162,400 records, with narratives of varying lengths and detail. Although this categorization streamlined the data, it remains imbalanced, with 56% of complaints relating to credit reporting issues and the remaining categories ranging between 8% and 14%. This imbalance presents a challenge in building an effective model, requiring tailored strategies to ensure accurate and balanced classification across all categories.\n",
